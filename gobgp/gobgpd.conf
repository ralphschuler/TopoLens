# Uncomment and modify the following section when you have a real BGP peer:
#
# [[neighbors]]
#   [neighbors.config]
#     neighbor-address = "YOUR_BGP_PEER_IP"
#     peer-as = YOUR_BGP_PEER_AS
#     [neighbors.config.timers.config]

#     [neighbors.afi-safis.config]
#       afi-safi-name = "ipv4-unicast"

# Note: This configuration runs without BGP neighbors for demo/testing purposes.
# The API service will use DEMO_MODE to generate synthetic BGP data when no 
# real BGP session is established.
